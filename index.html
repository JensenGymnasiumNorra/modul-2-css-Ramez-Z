                    <p>My name is Ramez Benjamin Zariab, many might not now this name but many will.
                    <br>
                    My dream is to become the absolute best version of not only myself but the best human possible.
                    In order to achieve this dream there are a few things i must work on. 
                    Addiction plagues humans worldwide. Addicitons ranging from gambling, consumption of harmful substances, concumption of non-harmful substances and the addiction to various media.
                    Overcoming my own addicitons is a core part of my own journey as well as other peoples journeys.
                    <br>
                    Over the years I've honed my mind to become that of a disciplined one.
                    Since i still go to school my only goal in the morning is to arrive to school by 8.00 and leave by 17.00.                    
                    This way i can maximize my studies while also making time for after school activites and hobbies like gymming.
                    <br>
                    I enjoy learning new things, exploring technology, and challenging myself every day.
                    Whether it's coding, reading, or working on creative projects, I always strive to improve and grow.</p>
