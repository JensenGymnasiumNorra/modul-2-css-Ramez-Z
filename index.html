                    <p>My name is Ramez Benjamin Zariab. Many might not know this name now, but many will.  
                    <br>
                    My dream is to become the absolute best version of myself — and ultimately, the best human I can be. To achieve this, I must work on several important aspects of my life.  
                    Addiction affects people worldwide, whether it’s gambling, harmful substances, seemingly harmless habits, or even excessive media consumption. Overcoming my own addictions is a crucial part of my journey, just as it is for many others.  
                    <br>
                    Over the years, I’ve trained my mind to be disciplined. Since I still attend school, my main goal each day is to arrive by 8:00 and leave by 17:00. This allows me to maximize my studies while making time for after-school activities and hobbies like going to the gym.  
                    <br>
                    I enjoy learning new things, exploring technology, and challenging myself daily. Whether it’s coding, reading, or working on creative projects, I always strive to grow and improve.</p>
